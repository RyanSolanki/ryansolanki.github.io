            <h2>A Message For My Love</h2>
            <p>
                Two years ago I made the decision to begin a journey. A journey that I was ready to embark on without any knowledge of where it would take me. 
                It all started when I met this girl. We would go out on cute dates, chat all night long until the sun shined through the blinds, and catch the 
                fictional sunrises and immersive sunsets together. This girl was special. Perfect, in fact. Over the past couple years she has made me feel levels 
                of joy, happiness, and comfort that I had never felt before. Her smile is contagious, her eyes I could stare into indefinitely, her voice calms my 
                mind, and her touch fills my heart. She is the only person who knows me for who I really am, and I know that nobody will be able to truly understand 
                the infinite amount of love I have for her. If I could go back two years, I would tell myself that the decision to live life with this amazing person 
                would be the best decision I will ever make.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><br> My Dearest Ayesha, <br><br>

                I know this is just the second chapter of our long journey together, but that feeling I had two years ago has only gotten stronger with time. I cannot 
                wait to see what the future holds for us. My goal is for this website to be the one place that encapsulates all of our memories together, one year at a 
                time. A place you can visit when you are having a bad day and need calm or comfort. A place where we can look back at all the good times and share them 
                with friends and family. And most importantly, a place where we can show our future kids what true love looks like. Happy Anniversary, my love! I am forever 
                grateful for you.<br><br>
                    
                Love,<br>
                Ryan
